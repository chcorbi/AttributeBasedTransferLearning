#Attribute Based Learning implementation
Authors : Charles Corbi√®re, Bernardo Cardoso Cordeiro, Aymeric Zhuo, Luciano Di Palma

## Synopsis

This package implement differents attribute-based learning approach:
- Direct Attributed Prediction (iAP)
- Indirect Attributed Prediction (IAP)

For this matter, we choose to try two learner :
- SVM
- Neural Network


Dataset included:
- Animals with Attributed dataset


## How to use it

0. Download Animal VGG19 features [here](http://www.ist.ac.at/~chl/AwA/AwA-features-vgg19.tar.bz2) and decompress it.

1. Compute features into animal categories in ./feat folder
```
python createFeaturesVector.py pathToFeatures
```
2. Concatenate features into a training dataset and a test dataset with their respectives labels in ./CreatedDataset
```
python concatenateSetFeatures.py
```
3. Train and predict a model given a method and a classifier. Platt parameters, prediction and probabilities saved in ./DAP
```
python DirectAttributePrediction.py DAP SVM
```
4. Generate and save confusion matrix plot and roc in ./results
```
python DAP_eval.py
```
